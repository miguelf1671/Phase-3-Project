# **Introduction**

- This is a GUI to help restaurants, especially cooks and chefs to be more organized and have a better communication. It's essentially a prep list that cooks and chefs can use to document a prep list where the user puts down they're name, position and then they add any items they need to track for the next day. When you save it will keep all that data in a file where it can easily be seen.
